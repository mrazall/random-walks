## Random walks in python
Random walk is a path that does not have a clear
direction, but is determined by a series of completely random solutions. Imagine that
an ant has gone mad and takes each new step in a random direction; its path
resembles a random walk.

The Random Walk class has been developed, which makes random decisions on
the choice of direction and distance. The class needs three attributes: a variable for storing the number of points in the path and two lists for the x and y coordinates of each point. The Random Walk class contains only two methods: __ init __() and fill_walk() for calculating random walk points.

Visualization of random walk using Matplotlib has been developed.
Color the dots in different colors according to their position. After displaying it in the Matplotlib viewport, pause with the viewport open. When closing the viewport, the program should ask if you want to generate the next walk. After entering the value y (=yes), and you will be able to generate walks that start near the starting point. To end the program, enter n (=no).

The animation is saved as a gif file or video.
