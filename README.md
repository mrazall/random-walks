Random walks in python
(random walk) is a path that does not have a clear
direction, but is determined by a series of completely random solutions. Imagine that
an ant has gone mad and takes each new step in a random direction; its path
resembles a random walk.
Random walk finds practical application in the natural sciences:
physics, biology, chemistry and economics. For example, a pollen grain on the surface
of a water drop moves along the surface of water because it is constantly
pushed by water molecules. The molecular motion in a drop of water is random, so
the path of the pollen grain on the surface is a random walk.
